This application is built in Ruby on Rails

It consists of the following menus

1)New Feed URL - This menu is used to create edit and delete feed URL's

2)List All Feeds - This menu is used to display all the feeds from all the URL's

3)RSS Reader - This menu contains the titles of the latest feeds of all the URL's in sorted order.

I used the  following urls to create feeds:

http://feeds.feedburner.com/TechCrunch/gaming
http://slashdot.org/index.rdf
http://www.aweber.com/blog/feed/
http://feeds.feedburner.com/TechCrunch/social
